VSB-ZPG (Basics of Computer Graphics)
	This repository contains a project for the "Základy počítačové grafiky" (Basics of Computer Graphics) course at VSB. The project is focused on creating a 3D graphics application using OpenGL and C++.

Project Overview
The main objectives of this project include:
	Implementing various 3D scenes with different types of objects, including basic shapes like triangles, squares, and complex models such as trees and bushes.
	Applying various shading techniques, including Phong shading, Lambert shading, and Blinn shading, to create realistic lighting effects.
	Using object-oriented programming principles to manage scenes, transformations, and shaders effectively.
	Implementing a camera system that allows for dynamic movement and multiple viewing perspectives.

Features
	Multiple Scenes: The project contains multiple predefined scenes, each showcasing different models and shaders.
	Lighting and Shading: Implements lighting models for realistic rendering, such as ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections.
	Camera Controls: Enables navigation through scenes with camera movements (WASD keys) and mouse controls.
	Shaders: Uses GLSL shaders for custom lighting and material effects.
	Transformation System: Includes composite transformations for scaling, rotation, and translation of objects.
